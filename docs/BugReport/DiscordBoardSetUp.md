Setting up Discord is a bit harder then Trello. The main reason is that Discord's Token are too powerful. One need to protect the token such as your user cannot abuse it. 

As a consequence the request have to go through a relay server. For the sake of simplicity we chose to use the Unity's Cloud Code Service. In term of pricing it goes for 1 000 000 free request per month and 0.5$ per supplementary million. If you feel like your project is going to need more, reach out to us so we could make a custom AWS implementation just for you.
