# The Bug Report

> Introduced in V 1.3

Thanks to this feature you can send tickets to a board. For now only trello is supported, but if you ever need to support more platforms (Jira, Azure Devops, Card decks, ...). Just tell us and we'll add it for you !!

This section is all about guiding you through the process of setting up your project to enable the Trello.
