# Code APIs

In this section you'll learn how to use the different components of the toolkit in your scripts.

> Many functionalities are going to be added to the APIs of the different component over time. Stay tuned.

## Gizmos 
You can create and delete gizmos at runtime using the Gizmos API.
> Note : this APIs might change depending on your feedback. Make sure to come back to this section if your logic breaks. 

For this version there only is API for the Collider Gizmos and the RaycastTo Gizmos.

> Feel free to request API features.
> If you make your own please show them to us, maybe they could be integrated in the toolkit.

## Console
You can use the **DebugLog** API of the in-game console to print logs in the in-game console directly.
