# About us

At 4Hands2cats, we create debugging tools to streamline development. As two devs (and two cats), we focus on robust, user-friendly solutions for Unity. Our first asset, a complete debug toolkit, works in build and runtime for full control. We're committed to improving and expanding our tools.
